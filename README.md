# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained natural language processing technique that focuses on identifying specific aspects or features of a product or service mentioned in text and determining the sentiment expressed toward each aspect. 
Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a single sentiment to an entire review, ABSA allows for a more detailed understanding. For example, in a product review stating, 
"The camera is excellent but the battery life is disappointing," ABSA can detect a positive sentiment toward the camera and a negative sentiment toward the battery. 
In the context of e-commerce, ABSA is particularly valuable. Customer reviews often touch on multiple product attributes, and ABSA helps extract structured insights from this unstructured data.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a critical challenge in e-commerce review analysis: automating the process of labeling and extracting aspect-level sentiments from unstructured and noisy customer feedback. 
Our goal is not only to perform sentiment analysis but to build a fully automated ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) pipeline capable of handling real-world, cluttered data. 
Additionally, the project integrates time series forecasting to predict future trends in customer sentiment and product performance based on historical aspect-level sentiment data. 
This enables businesses to anticipate shifts in customer preferences and proactively adapt.

# Problem Statement
These challenges underscore the importance and value of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), particularly in e-commerce where customer reviews are vast, unstructured, and often noisy. 
However, our main problem statement goes beyond sentiment analysis—it focuses on automating the process of generating labeled datasets from such unstructured domains. 
Since manually labeling aspect-sentiment pairs is costly, we aim to address this by building a system that can automatically extract aspects and determine sentiments using a simple yet efficient model architecture that balances performance and practicality.

# Methodology
To tackle the problem of aspect extraction, we use SpaCy—a fast and lightweight NLP library for automating aspect extraction. 
SpaCy offers efficient and customizable pipelines for entity and pattern recognition, making it well-suited for domain-specific tasks like aspect identification. 
For sentiment analysis, we employ a BERT model with multi-head attention, which allows the system to capture nuanced contextual sentiment related to each extracted aspect. 
Given that our dataset is largely unlabeled, we incorporate a semi-supervised learning approach using an active learning framework. 
This approach allows the model to iteratively select the most samples from the data for human annotation, significantly reducing labeling effort while improving model accuracy.

# Goals
* Automatically extract product aspects from unstructured customer reviews.
* Classify sentiments associated with each aspect accurately.
* Reduce dependency on manual labeling by using a semi-supervised approach.
* Deliver structured insights to support business intelligence and improve customer experience.
* Forecast future aspect-level sentiment trends using time series models to support strategic planning.
  
This approach automates aspect extraction and sentiment analysis from real-world, unstructured, and unlabeled e-commerce data using SpaCy, BERT with multi-head attention, and an active learning framework. 
With the addition of time series forecasting, it enables not only current insights but also future sentiment trend prediction. Together, these methods support better product improvement, enhanced customer satisfaction, 
and aspect-level trend tracking—making the solution both practical and impactful for real-world business applications.
